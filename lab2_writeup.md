During this Lab 2 learning process, I primarily developed a note-taking application based on the Flask framework and SQLAlchemy ORM, successfully deploying it live via Vercel.
Throughout implementation, I studied and practised RESTful API design and implementation, mastering database model definition, relationship establishment, and CRUD operations. 
Concurrently, on the frontend, I experimented with JavaScript for asynchronous requests to achieve smoother user interaction. 
The project incorporates comprehensive CRUD functionality, search capabilities, and an extension feature utilising AI to generate note content. 
The frontend interface employs responsive design to adapt to various devices. Development challenges included database path configuration errors, date/time format incompatibilities, and inefficient search performance, all resolved progressively through documentation research and AI debugging tools. 
This experiment deepened my understanding of modern web application architecture patterns while enhancing my capabilities in full-stack development, front-end/back-end data interaction, code organisation, and problem-solving.
